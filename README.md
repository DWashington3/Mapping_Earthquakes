# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
Using Mapbox API, I conveyed earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are marked on the map along with earthquakes larger than 4.5 in magnitude.
## Results
The end-user can toggle between three different tile layers. Dark, Satellite, and Street Satellite are the three different Mapbox styles. Furthermore, there is a legend explaining the significance of each color. In each circle, the radius is based on the earthquake's magnitude. 
Using layers, the end-user can focus on the information they are interested in. A user can toggle between the following overlays: 

### Overlays

## Conclusion

The live console helped me pinpoint my errors. When troubleshooting, this feedback was incredibly helpful. I was able to better understand how each line of code worked in the JavaScript and HTML files with the console feedback.
